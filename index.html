                <h3>A Short Timeline of Jim Rohn's Life</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1930</b> - Born in Yakima, Washington; at some point, Rohn's parents moved to their farm in
                        Caldwell, Idaho, where he grew up as an only child.</li>
                    <li><b>1955</b> - At the peak of his weariness, Rohn met his soon-to-be mentor—an entrepreneur named
                        Earl Schoaff; up to this point, Rohn had gotten married, dropped out of college after only one
                        year, and was struggling financially; Rohn joined one of Schoaff's direct selling businesses.

                    <li><b>1957</b> - Rohn moved to another one of Schoaff's businesses, where Schoaff began mentoring

                    <li><b>1960</b> - Schoaff's business expanded internationally, and Rohn was selected as the

                        at the Beverly Hills Hotel launched him into the personal development business. He soon after
                        gave seminars all over the country, and eventually wrote several books.</li>
